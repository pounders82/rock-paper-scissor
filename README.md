## General info
This project is simple game that I have created to practice the fundmentals of Python.  This is a rock paper scissor command line game.  The program asks the user to type in rock paper or scissor. The input is converted to lowercase and checked to see if it s one of the choices in the list.  The program then randomly chooses one of the options in the list.  It then uses if else statements to see which player won and displays the winner on the screen.
